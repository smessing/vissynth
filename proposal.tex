Vissynth is a visual synthesizer, receiving input from a webcam. 

Our group would like to design a program that functions as a
visual synthesizer. We intend to take input from a web camera and
use this input to drive a musical synthesizer. To achieve this, we
will separate the image into a grid, which will roughly correspond
to the grid of a synthesizer: an array of buttons, where columns
represent "time steps", every ON button in each column goes off at
the same time point, and the rows represent frequencies, with
lower rows representing lower tones and higher rows representing
higher tones. The program will decide which squares of the grid
are ON and which are OFF based on the following process:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item turn the contrast all the way up on the image
  \item count up the number of white and black pixels within each square of the grid
  \item for each square, mark that square as ON if there are more white than black pixels, OFF otherwise.
\end{enumerate}
